# dnsmq-messagebus

A message bus implementation for nodes reachable through DNS resolution. Based on [ØMQ](http://zeromq.org/)

## WIP!

### Install
```bash
$ npm install --save dnsmq-messagebus
```
**Note:** in order to use this library you have to [install ØMQ](http://zeromq.org/community) on the box where your node process will run.
